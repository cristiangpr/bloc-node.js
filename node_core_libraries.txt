A:  It allows is to access the file system

2. What is the difference between sync and non-sync methods in the fs module?

A: Synchronous, or blocking, means that your code runs in sequential order. The program waits for the line of code to finish executing before moving on to the next line of code.

   Asynchronous, or non-blocking, means your code does not wait for the current line to execute before moving on to run the next line.  

3. Why are modules used?

A:  So we can access external libraries since serve side code doesn't use HTML.

4. Why are libraries such as fs used in Node programming?

A: Libraries in node are called modules. They are used to add methods that we want to use.


Code Practice

Create a Github repo called simple-http-node-server. Create an HTTP server on port 3000 with a request handler that creates a file named hello-world.txt. You will be using the fs module to do this. Write the content: "Hello to this great world" to the hello-world.txt file. Please submit your finished code in your submission.
